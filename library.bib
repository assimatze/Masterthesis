abstract = {Contribution to a corporate wiki for the purpose of knowledge transfer can be very low because of continuously pressing tasks, a chronic lack of spare time, and mo- tivational reasons. This is a problem because the wiki fails to achieve its purpose of collecting valuable knowledge, and becomes less attractive through this over time. We present a reputation-based system that socially rewards employees for their contributions, and thereby increases their motivation to contribute to the wiki. In a four months trial of productive use with two work groups, we could show that our concept increases the quan- tity and quality of articles in the repository, leads to higher activity in general, and draws employees to the wiki who had not contributed before.

abstract = {There is a problem with documentation and architectural design in agile projects. This is the result of interviews we have conducted with 37 software engineering experts from industry and academia. In our paper, we analyze the interview results and the origins of the revealed issues. We propose ways to integrate software design methodologies into agile development, and reputation mechanism to solve documentation problems. The contributions of this paper are (i) an investigation of expert opinions on design and documentation problems, (ii) an analysis of problem origins, and (iii) proposals for future improvements of agile processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {NikeFuel is the fuel of the Nike+ community. A fuel that has made two million users burn more than 68 bn. calories and that proliferates with each kilometer. The athletic performance of Nike+ users is measured via sensors in Nike sports shoes and an Apple iPod or iPhone, documented on the Nike+platform and converted into NikeFuel. In doing so, users may visualize their progress, compare their performance with others, and obtain different status levels that reflect their athletic potential. This approach derives from the domain of game design and is called gamification enriching products, services, and information systems with game-design elements in order to positively influence motivation, productivity, and behavior of users. In the consumer sector, various successful examples for gamication are gaining recognition. Gamication is a persuasive technology that attempts to influence user behavior by activating individual motives via game-design elements. As a consequence, this approach does not deal with designing games that can generally be defined as solving rule-based artificial conflicts or simulations. Thus, gamication needs to be contrasted to related concepts such as serious games and games with a purpose.},

abstract = {In 2007 a new form of persuasion emerged: mass interpersonal persuasion (MIP). The advances in online social networks now allow individuals to change attitudes and behaviors on a mass scale. MIP has six components: persuasive experience, automated structure, social distribution, rapid cycle, huge social graph, and measured impact. Before the launch of Facebook Platform, these six components had never come together in one system. As tools for creating MIP become available to ordinary people, individuals and small groups can better reach and persuade masses. This new phenomenon will change the future of persuasion.},

abstract = {Der Umgang mit Lernspielen kann entweder spielerische oder ernste Z{\"{u}}ge tragen. Dieser Beitrag fragt danach, inwiefern sich aus einer solchen Rahmung Konsequenzen f{\"{u}}r das p{\"{a}}dagogische Potenzial von Game-based Learning ergeben. Es wurde vermutet, dass es gerade die Abgrenzung des Spiels zum Ernst des Alltags ist, die es so unterhaltsam und motivierend macht, dass andererseits aber die Scheinhaftigkeit des Spiels wom{\"{o}}glich die Bereitschaft der Adressaten zur {\"{U}}bernahme der Lernspielinhalte in ihr Wissensrepertoire reduziert. Ein und dasselbe Lernspiel k{\"{o}}nnte somit, abh{\"{a}}ngig von der Definition der Situation, als mehr oder weniger unterhaltsam, aber komplement{\"{a}}r auch als mehr oder weniger informativ erachtet werden. In einem experimentellen Setting mit Realsch{\"{u}}ler/innen der 8. Klasse ($\eta$ = 54) wurden diese Hypothesen empirisch gepr{\"{u}}ft. Versuchspersonen aus zwei unabh{\"{a}}ngigen Stichproben bearbeiteten das gleiche Lernspiel, den einen wurde jedoch suggeriert, es handle sich um eine Lernsoftware f{\"{u}}r den Unterricht, den anderen, es sei ein reines Computerspiel f{\"{u}}r die Freizeit. Im Anschluss wurden per Fragebogen die Unterhaltung und die Bereitschaft zur {\"{U}}bernahme der Medieninhalte erfasst. Der Bezugsrahmen allein hatte zwar nicht den erwarteten unmittelbaren Einfluss auf Unterhaltung und Rezeptionsbereitschaft, es ergaben sich aber in deskriptiver und teils auch inferenzstatistischer Hinsicht Interaktionen mit dem Bezugsrahmen und dem Geschlecht der Versuchspersonen bzw. ihrer Pr{\"{a}}ferenz f{\"{u}}r Lernspiele.},

An understanding of how programmers actively manage this knowledge provides a foundation for evaluating cognitive theories and building better tools.

abstract = {In this paper we outline the idea to adopt gamification techniques to engage, train, monitor, and motivate all the players involved in the development of complex software artifacts, from the inception to the deployment and maintenance. The paper introduces the concept of gamification and proposes a research approach to understand how its principles may be successfully applied to the process of software development. Applying gamification to software engineering is not as straightforward as it may appear since it has to be casted to the peculiarities of this domain. Existing literature in the area has already recognized the possible use of such technology in the context of software development, however how to design and use gamification in this context is still an open question. This leads to several research challenges which are organized in a fascinating research agenda that is part of the contribution of this paper. Finally, to support the proposed ideas we present a preliminary experiment that shows the effect of gamification on the performance of students involved in a software engineering project.},

abstract = {Delivering increasingly complex software-reliant systems demands better ways to manage the long-term effects of short-term expedients. The technical debt metaphor is gaining significant traction in the agile development community as a way to understand and communicate such issues. The idea is that developers sometimes accept compromises in a system in one dimension (e.g., modularity) to meet an urgent demand in some other dimension (e.g., a deadline), and that such compromises incur a "debt": on which "interest" has to be paid and which the "principal" should be repaid at some point for the long-term health of the project. We argue that the software engineering research community has an opportunity to study and improve this concept. We can offer software engineers a foundation for managing such trade-offs based on models of their economic impacts. Therefore, we propose managing technical debt as a part of the future research agenda for the software engineering field.},
